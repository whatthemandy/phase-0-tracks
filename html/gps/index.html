<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? - The tags are used to help with code readability.  If you have hundreds of lines of code, these tags will help someone understand the significance of each section way more quickly than if everything was labeled <div>.-->
<!--What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? - The browser displays the elements on the page in the order your html code lists them.-->
<!--What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? - I learned how to create new snippets (I'm sure I'll create tons as I go along!), and that you can right click anywhere in the sublime window as a shortcut to open the code in your browser.-->
<!-- What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can {you deepen} your understanding of this concept? -I'm not totally clear on when to use all the semantic tags, especially the "section" tag.  I think reading other people's code and looking up more examples will help.-->
