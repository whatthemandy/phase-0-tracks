# An Introduction to JavaScript

The purpose of these lessons is to explore the features of JavaScript from the perspective of Ruby.  If you are not already familiar with Ruby, much of what you will find here will not make sense. After finishing these lessons, you will be familiar with the basic syntax and core features of JavaScript, and you should be able to recognize and articulate key points of differentiation from Ruby.

We will not be exploring all of the features that JavaScript provides. This guide doesn't cover using JavaScript to build interactive web pages.
