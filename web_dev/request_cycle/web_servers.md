### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Linux gives the user a lot of power - it doesn't prevent user errors and assumes the user knows what they're doing.  Some key principles of the system are speed, efficiency, and standardization.  Linux is also free and open-source.

### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
Virtual Private Servers are web hosting servers that can be set up and maintained privately rather than through a large web-hosting service.  The main advantages to setting up a personal/private server are stability (your site isn't affected by the activity or crashing of other sites on the same server) and control (the user has full root access and can install any software you'd like).  VPSs are also more secure and don't differ much in cost (compared to non-private hosted servers).

### Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
The main reason not to use root is security.  The root user has access to everything and there are no safeguards.  If you were to install or run something harmful the program will let you and won't make you confirm changes, which can lead to accidental damage to your system.
