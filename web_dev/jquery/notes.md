# jQuery Research
## Plan of action:
Research a few different jQuery websites to get an idea of what's out there.  Get a good look at the variety of ways there are to learn it.  Skim through a couple different approaches and choose whichever one feels best.  Run with it!

### Look it up:
* Documentation
* Guides
* Tutorials
* Cheat Sheets

### Try it out:
When I find good examples, try them out

### Take a break
Every section (or half hour or so), take a quick break and assess progress

## Results:
I started with w3schools.com and it was so great I lost track of time and wasn't able to check out any other sites before time ran out.  I usually do Codecademy though so it was nice to discover another site and learn through different types of examples and practice.
